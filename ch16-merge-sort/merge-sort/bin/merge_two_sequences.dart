/// it takes two iterables as inputs rather than lists. Hereâ€™s the
/// function signature to start off:
///
/// ```
/// List<E> _merge<E extends Comparable<dynamic>>(
///   Iterable<E> first,
///   Iterable<E> second,
/// )
/// ```
void main() {
  // See lib/merge_sort_2.dart for the source code.
