/// Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide two real-life
/// examples for each data structure.
//
// Queues have a behavior of first-in-first-out. What comes in first must come out first. 
// Items in the queue are inserted from the rear and removed from the front.
// Queue Examples:
// 1. Line in a movie theatre: You would hate for people to cut the line at the movie theatre when buying tickets!
// 2. Printer: Multiple people could print documents from a printer in a similar first-come-first-serve manner.
// 
// Stacks have a behavior of last-in-first-out. Items on the stack are inserted at the top and removed from the top.
// Stack Examples:
// 1. Stack of plates: You stack plates on top of each other and remove the top plate every time you use one.
//    Isnâ€™t this easier than grabbing the one at the bottom?
// 2. Undo functionality: Imagine typing words on a keyboard. Clicking Ctrl-Z will undo the most recent text you typed.
